<p> Hi friends, </p>

<p> I am asking for your support to serve as one of our two class marshals. </p>

<p>What struck me about the role is the opportunity to <b>plan graduation week events</b> and serve as a class resource leading up to Commencement. It has been a great pleasure to plan class events throughout the year, and regardless of a title, I hope to continue to do so. As a class marshal, I will spend my time leading up to graduation working with all of you to <b>develop activities to bring us closer together</b> and solidify our network of mutual support as we head back out into the world to do great things. </p>

<p>Beyond graduation, the role evolves to focus on the important task of <b>serving as a class ambassador</b> with the Office of Alumni Affairs. I hope to continue to help bring our class together in the years to come by making sure we stay in contact and support each other in our projects, campaigns for public office, and leadership challenges.</p>

<p>I thank you for your time and would be honored to serve as a class marshal with any of our wonderful fellow classmates whose names have been put forward. If you would like to learn more about my goals for the role, please read below.</p>

     <p> Best, </p>

     <p> Jonathan </p>
