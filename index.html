<div class="center">

<p> Hi friends, </p>

<p> I am asking for your support to serve as one of our two Class Marshals. </p>

<h3>Planning Great Graduation Events</h3>

You might as well call the Class Marshal the Class Event Planner.  The Marshal plans graduation week events and serve as a class resource leading up to Commencement. It has been a great pleasure to plan class events throughout the year,* and regardless of a title, I hope to continue to do so.  As a Class Marshal, I will spend my time leading up to graduation working with all of you to develop activities to bring us closer together and solidify our network of mutual support as we head back out into the world to do great things.  

<h3>Serving as a Class Ambassador</h3>

After graduation, the role evolves to focus on the important task of serving as a class ambassador to the Office of Alumni Affairs. I hope to continue to bring our class together in the years to come by making sure we stay in contact and support each other in our careers, campaigns for public office, and leadership challenges.

<h3>Bringing the Love </h3>

This would be chance for me to give back to a class that has already given me so much in friends, learning, advice, connections, and deep moments. I want to make sure that each member of our class leaves feeling deeply appreciated and strongly connected to this community. Because this is a team effort, I would be honored to serve as a Mid-Career Class Marshal alongside any of our wonderful fellow classmates whose names have been put forward.
<br><br>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions. If you would like to learn more about my goals for the role, please read below. Finally, I am asking for your vote. 
<br>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, <br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan</p>
